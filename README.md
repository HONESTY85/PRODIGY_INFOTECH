As part of my cybersecurity learning journey, I developed and explored a variety of tools that reflect key skills in ethical hacking, digital forensics, and secure software development. Each tool was designed with simplicity and functionality in mind, helping me understand how attackers and defenders interact with systems in real-world scenarios. Below is a brief overview of the tools I built or used during this project.

1. Caesar Cipher Text Tool
The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. I created a Python script that allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages by shifting letters in the alphabet by a fixed number. This project helped me understand the basics of cryptography and how substitution ciphers work. I also added a brute-force mode that attempts all possible keys, which simulates how attackers might break weak encryption.

2. Image Encryption Tool
To explore data protection beyond text, I developed a tool that encrypts images by manipulating pixel values. Using the Pillow library, the tool adds or subtracts a numeric key to each RGB pixel. This exercise taught me how digital data like images can be protected and how easy it is to obscure visual content using basic mathematical logic.

3. Python Keylogger
As a practical introduction to monitoring user input, I created a basic keylogger using the pynput library. The keylogger records keystrokes and saves them to a file. It was a valuable exercise in understanding how keyloggers work and how they can be detected or prevented. This project highlighted the importance of ethical use, since keyloggers can easily become malicious if misused.

4. Network Packet Sniffer
Using scapy, I built a tool that captures and displays network packets in real time. It shows details like source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data. This project introduced me to how sniffers are used in penetration testing and helped me see how raw network traffic can reveal important security insight
5. Password Complexity Checker
   Using Pythonâ€™s built-in re (regular expression) module. This tool evaluates the strength of a password based on specific complexity requirements and provides real-time feedback to users.
